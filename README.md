# **Basic Information**

## **About `playbook`**
___

### `playbook` is an experimental, prototypical concept-recall playbook that was created to _**take advantage of**_ of some unique concept formation strategies that most people unconciously use when learning new concepts elsewhere in life. The `playbook` was conceptualized _**from the ground up**_ to exploit concept-recall strategies such as spaced-repetition and word-to-abstract-concepts association. 

### _**From the get-go,**_ the play calling system of `playbook` was designed to primarily reduce _**verboseness**_ and create clarity when we _**set out**_ to perform complex programming maneuvers. The `playbook` contains lots of plays that you need to execute as a professional software **player**. The `playbook` was planned with some objectives in mind like thoroughness, usability and clarity. The learning curve for `playbook` could be _**steep**_ at the start since you need to _**take a lot of things in** as you are _**going through the playbook**_. Nonetheless, when you figure out the playbook it'll get easier, you'll tend to realize the power behind spaced-repetition and word-to-abstract-concepts assocication. The `playbook` works _**hand in hand**_ with the **"experiments"** repositories on `fluentsinc`: you would work with `rookie-experiments` at the start but eventually you would work mostly _**in tandem**_ with `prometheus-experiments`. It's absolutely neccessary that you _**get a good grip on**_ concepts found in "experiments" repositories so that you can start using the `playbook` effectively.

## **How to use the `playbook`**

### The playbook contains loads of **plays** and **play calls** that you would find useful going forward. The playbook keeps all the **plays** and **play calls** categorically keeping a directory structure. So if there was a play or a play call related to "html", then you need to go into the " and So all you need to do is to, look up the play on `playbook`, execute the linear steps defined for that play in there. 


## **Common Descriptions**

### **play** 

### any linear(straightforward) step or steps you would take to accomplish something you want to do. Linear steps are nothing but assignments that you need to follow in a predefined sequence to accomplish something. So for the first linear step you would do something and the second linear step you would do something else and so on and so forth until you get the job done. Plays are usually a word or words that signal you to follow some predefined linear steps. 

### For example, there are linear steps that you can take to create a text file with your name written on it. The steps could be: 1. you would create a text file by using notepad or wordpad, 2. Once you've created a new text file, you would write your name on it. Let's say, we give a name "text-x" to the above linear steps(play). Then when you get assigned a play "text-x", your job is to execute the above two linear steps defined for that "text-x" play. 

### Another example could be driving a car. The linear steps for driving a car are: 1. open the door 2. get into the driver's seat. 3. insert the keys 4. start the engine. 5. drive. We could call the car driving play (linear steps) as "bugatti". So when you get assigned a play "bugatti", your job is to follow all the linear steps and get the job done by following the linear step defined above. 

### **play call** 

### a play call refers to group of plays put together in a sentence. 

### For example, `text-x pilot 23 bash-x` is a play call which contains three plays in it. You need to perform the playcall as defined in the playbook. The individual plays might be executed differently when called in a playcall so don't assume you can just execute the plays. In a playcall, the plays follow a predefined sequence which you should always follow.   

### More often than not, you would need to execute two or more plays to accomplish a single task in a sequential way. A play call lets you see the plays and sequence involved in executing those combined plays. 

### Going forward, all the programming tasks or assignments that you get will be play calls. 

### **player**

### any human that can follow and execute linear steps effectively. 

### **Code Words**

### Code words are normal words that mean something in the playbook. For example, code word "Rookie-X" could mean `rookie-experiments` repository. The code words always start with an uppercase letter as you can see in "Rookie-X" and that's how you could recognize that you're dealing with a code word. If the code word has multiple words separted by a hyphen, then the new word also starts with an uppercase letter. There are two types of code words you would see: constant and variable. 

### **Constant Code Words**

### Constant code words are code words that does not change. 

### For example, if the code word maps the word "cat" to "https://www.google.com" then if you see "cat" anywhere on the playbook, you should realize that we mean "https://www.google.com". 

### **Variable Code Words**

### Variable code words are code words that vary according to a predefined filler rule. The filler rule tells you that you need to fill some things into the brackets [] to _**make sense of**_ of the code word. So basically you would see a pretty good description of what we need to put into the brackets and you need to put that into the place without the brackets. 

### For example, in the variable code word below. 

### **fluentsinc/[repository-name]** - [repository-name] i
