# **Basic Information**

## **About `playbook`**
___

### `playbook` is an experimental, prototypical concept recall playbook that was created to _**take advantage of**_ of some unique concept formation strategies that most people unconciously use when learning new concepts elsewhere in life. The `playbook` was conceptualized _**from the ground up**_ to exploit concept formation strategies such as spaced repetition and word-to-abstract-concepts association. 

### _**From the get-go,**_ the play calling system of `playbook` was designed to primarily reduce _**verboseness**_ and create clarity when we _**set out**_ to perform complex programming maneuvers. The `playbook` contains lots of plays that you need to execute as a professional software **player**. The `playbook` was planned with some objectives in mind like thoroughness, usability and quick cross-referencing ability. The learning curve for `playbook` could be _**steep**_ at the start since you need to _**take a lot of things in** as you are _**going through the playbook**_. Nonetheless, when you figure out the playbook it'll get easier, you'll tend to realize the power behind spaced repetition and word-to-abstract-concepts assocication. The `playbook` works _**hand in hand**_ with the **"experiments"** repositories: you would work with`rookie-experiments` at the start but eventually you would work mostly _**in tandem**_ with `prometheus-experiments`. It's absolutely neccessary that you _**get a good grip on**_ concepts found in "experiments" repositories so that you can start using the `playbook` effectively.

## **Common Descriptions**

### **play** 

### any linear(straightforward) step or steps you would take to accomplish something you want to do. Linear steps are nothing but assignments that you need to follow in a predefined sequence to accomplish something. So for the first linear step you would do something and the second linear step you would do something else and so on and so forth until you get the job done. Plays are usually a word or words that signals you to follow some predefined linear steps. 

### For example, there are linear steps that you can take to create a text file with your name written on it. The steps could be: 1. you would create a text file by using notepad or wordpad, 2. Once you've created a new text file, you would write your name on it. Let's say, we give a name "text-x" to the above linear steps(play). Then when you get assigned a play "text-x", your job is to execute the above two linear steps defined for that "text-x" play. 

### Another example could be driving a car. The linear steps for driving a car are: 1. open the door 2. get into the driver's seat. 3. insert the keys 4. start the engine. 5. drive. We could call the car driving play (linear steps) "bugatti". So when you get assigned a play "bugatti", your job is to follow all the linear steps and get the job done. 

### **play call** 

### a play call refers to group of plays put together in a sentence. 

### For example, `text-x pilot 23 bash-x` is a play call which contains three plays in it. 

### More often than not, you would need to execute two or more plays to accomplish a single task in a sequential way. A play call lets you see the plays and sequence involved in executing those plays. 

### Going forward, all the programming tasks or assignments will be play calls. 

### **player**

### any human that can follow and execute linear steps effectively. 

### **Code Words**

### Code words are normal words that mean something in the playbook. For example, code word "Rookie-x" would mean `rookie-experiments` repository. The code words always start with an uppercase letter as you can see in "Rookie-x" and that's how you could recognize that you're dealing with a code word. There are two types of code words: constant and variable. 

### **Variable Code Words**

### Variable code words are code words that vary according to a predefined filler rule. The filler rule tells you that you need to fill some things into the brackets [] to _**make sense of**_ of the code word. 

### For example, in the variable 

### **fluentsinc/[repository-name]** - "fluentsinc/rookie-experiments"

___

## **How to use the `playbook`**

### The playbook contains loads of **plays** and **play calls** that you would find useful going forward. The playbook keeps all the **plays** and **play calls** categorically and So all you need to do is to, look up the play on `playbook`, execute the linear steps defined for that play in there.  

## **Base Code Words** 

### **Variable Code Words**

### Variable code words are code words that vary according to a predefined filler rule. The filler rule tells you that you need to fill some things into the brackets []. 

### For example, in the variable 

### **fluentsinc/[repository-name]** - "fluentsinc/rookie-experiments"


### **Constant Code Words**

### Constant code words never change. They are 

### **rookie-x** - rookie-experiments repository (https://github.com/fluentsinc/rookie-experiments)



## **Base Plays**

### **huddle |experiments repository name|** - the "huddle" play followed by two vertical bars (||) tells you to execute the below linear steps. 

### 1.  When you get a "huddle" play, every play call you get assigned will be based on the "experiments repository" inside the vertical bars(||). You would constantly refer the "experiment repository" to execute any play calls you might get.  

###  For example, `huddle |rookie-x|` means "rookie-experiments" should be the experiment repository you need to refer to perform your assignment. Every play call will be based on "rookie-experiments". 


### **ready** - "ready" play tells you to execute the below linear steps. 

### 1. "ready" play after a "huddle" play tells you to do necessary steps so that you can refer to "experiment repository" consistently and easily. Those necessary steps are given below. If the play calls you see below doesn't make sense, keep going forward. It'll make sense when grasp the whole `rookie-playbook`. 

### 2. `bash-x git clone |rookie-x|`

### 3. `vs-code space |rookie-x| name->self`

### 4.
