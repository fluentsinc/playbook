## **Base Plays**
___
___

### **rookie-play** 

### "rookie" play tells you that you need to follow `playbook/rookie` and `fluentsinc/rookie-experiments` carefully. Since you're a rookie and have not mastered `prometheus-experiments/git` experiments, you need to follow `playbook/rookie` and particularly `fluentsinc/rookie-experiments/git` focusedly because a simple lack of attention to detail on your part can and will jeopardize the whole team's progress. You will need to be cautious and attentive when you get this play. 
___ 

### **huddle |experiments-repository-name| |technology-name|**  

### "huddle" play followed by two vertical bars ( || ) tells you to execute the below linear steps:

### 1.  When you get a "huddle" play, every play call you get assigned will be based on the "experiments repository" inside the vertical bars( || ). You preferably would constantly refer the "experiments repository" to execute any play calls you might get.  

###  For example, `huddle |Rookie-X|` means "rookie-experiments" should be the experiment repository you need to refer to perform your assignment. Every play call will be based on "rookie-experiments". 

### 2. Sometimes, the "huddle" wants you to _**zero in**_ on a technology inside the "experiments repository". In this scenario, you would get the "technology name" inside the vertical bar next to "experiments repository". This means you need to look at the "experiments repository" first, then you need to look for a folder with the "technology name" and refer "technology name" extensively to execute the plays.

### For example, `huddle |Prom-X| |bash|` means you need to look at "prometheus-experiments" repository first then take a look at the technology "bash" inside "prometheus-experiments". The directory "prometheus-experiments/bash" is where you need to _**zero in**_ on and find experiments that help you execute the plays. 

___

### **pilot |pilot-number|**

### "pilot" play followed by two vertical bars ( || ) tells you to execute the below linear steps:

### 1. When you get assigned a "pilot" play, you need to find the pilot with the **pilot-number** given inside the vertical bars. The "technology" and "experiments-repository" of the pilot should be found from the "huddle" play. 

### For example, let's say, the "huddle" play had `Rookie-X` as `experiments-repository` and `git` as `technology`. Then, the play `pilot |23|` tells you to find `pilot-23` of Git from `rookie-experiments` repository. 

### 2. Sometimes, the **pilot-number** might be a variable code word in a play. Just substitute the specific filler word for the variable code word in these instances. 

### For example, `pilot |[all-pilots]|` is a "pilot" play where you need to put the specific filler word that `[all-pilots]` defines as the pilot-number. 

___

### **storm**

### The "storm" play is usually called once you've found the pilot of a particular technology in an experiments-repository. This play tells you to brainstorm all the experiments in the pilot.
