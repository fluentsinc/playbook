## **Base Plays**

### **huddle |experiments repository name|** - the "huddle" play followed by two vertical bars (||) tells you to execute the below linear steps. 

### 1.  When you get a "huddle" play, every play call you get assigned will be based on the "experiments repository" inside the vertical bars(||). You would constantly refer the "experiment repository" to execute any play calls you might get.  

###  For example, `huddle |rookie-x|` means "rookie-experiments" should be the experiment repository you need to refer to perform your assignment. Every play call will be based on "rookie-experiments". 


### **ready** - "ready" play tells you to execute the below linear steps. 

### 1. "ready" play after a "huddle" play tells you to do necessary steps so that you can refer to "experiment repository" consistently and easily. Those necessary steps are given below. If the play calls you see below doesn't make sense, keep going forward. It'll make sense when grasp the whole `rookie-playbook`. 

### 2. `bash-x git clone |rookie-x|`

### 3. `vs-code space |rookie-x| name->self`

### 4.
